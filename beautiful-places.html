    <h1>Beautiful Places</h1>
    <p>Nepal is a surprisingly diverse country that attracts visitors for many reasons. Some are lured by the call of the mountains and seeking to climb or trek in the Himalayas, others are intrigued by the culture and the famous city of Kathmandu, and yet others come hoping to find some sort of spiritual awakening. Nepal can be an adrenaline adventure, a cultural eye opener, a life-changing experience, or all of the above.</p>
    <p>Most travelers spend some time in Kathmandu visiting sacred and historic attractions, and then head out to other parts of the country. Some of the best places to visit outside of the capital are Chitwan National Park for wildlife viewing, and the lakeside town of Pokhara, a popular area for embarking on treks.</p>
    <p>Trekkers will find a variety of options across Nepal, with the most important areas being the Everest, Annapurna, and Langtang regions.</p>
    <br />
    <h2 id="ktm">1. Kathmandu</h2>
    <img src="images/nepal-kathmandu-city-view.jpg" alt="Kathmandu City View" />
    <p>Kathmandu, the capital and largest city in Nepal, is like no other city in the world. The decaying buildings in the heart of the city are a stark contrast to the lively atmosphere that permeates the streets. The smell of incense wafts from stores while street sellers push their goods, and people go about their daily lives, all against a backdrop of historic temples and carved statues.</p>
    <p>The highlight of Kathmandu has long been Durbar Square, the largest of the palace squares in the three royal cities and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Temples and monuments of varying shapes, sizes, styles, and faiths can be found here.</p>
    <br />
    <h2 id="pkh">2. Pokhara</h2>
    <img src="images/nepal-pokhara-lake.jpg" alt="Pokhara Lake" />
    <p>Set at the base of the foothills and surrounded by some of the highest mountains in the world - Dhaulagiri, Manaslu, and Annapurna I - Pokhara is one of Nepal's most scenic cities. For trekkers, Pokhara is the gateway to the Himalayas and the starting point for treks to Jomsom and the Annapurna region. It's also a wonderful spot to relax for a bit, either before or after a hiking trip.</p>
    <br />
    <h2 id="apr">3. Trekking In Annapurna Region</h2>
    <img src="images/nepal-annapurna-region-hiking.jpg" alt="Annapurna Region Hiking" />
    <p>The Annapurna Region is one of the most popular trekking regions in Nepal, with options that range from a few days to a few weeks. Three main routes in the Annapurna Region intersect and combine in places, and you can opt to do a portion or a variation on the routes. The routes are well marked and easy to follow.</p>
    <br />
    <h2 id="cnp">4. Chitwan National Park</h2>
    <img src="images/nepal-chitwan-national-park-rhino.jpg" alt="Chitwan National Park" />
    <p>Chitwan National Park is the place to come to experience a different side of Nepal. This is a wonderful place for wildlife viewing and it has a safari-type atmosphere. At an altitude of only 100 meters in some areas, much lower than Kathmandu at 1,400 meters, Chitwan has a tropical monsoon climate, quite different than what you'd expect to find in Nepal.</p>
    <p>Travelers come here to see wildlife. The park is home to rhinos, Bengal tigers, leopards, sloth bears, gaur (buffalo), deer, and many other critters. Freshwater dolphins (gangetic) and crocodiles inhabit the rivers and streams but are rarely seen. More than 500 species of birds make Chitwan a paradise for ornithologists. Tours from the lodges take you out into the park, either on foot, or more often, on elephants for close-up views of the animals.</p>
    <br />
    <h2 id="snt">5. Swayambhunath (Monkey Temple)</h2>
    <img src="images/nepal-swayambhunath-monkey-temple.jpg" alt="Swayambhunath (Monkey Temple)" />
    <p>Set on a hilltop to the west of Kathmandu, Swayambhunath is the second most important shrine in the Kathmandu Valley after Boudhanath. Due to the resident monkeys that inhabit parts of the temple, it is more affectionately known as the Monkey Temple.</p>
    <p>The Swayambhu Stupa, painted with the eyes of the omnipresent god, forms the centerpiece of the temple complex. It was originally a prehistoric cult site, but the temple complex dates to the 5th century. Swayambhu plays a major part in the lives of the Vajrayana Buddhists of Northern Nepal and Tibet, but especially of the Newari Buddhists of the Kathmandu Valley.</p>
